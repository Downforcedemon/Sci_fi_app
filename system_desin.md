CORE IDEA ---> I am designing an app that is sci-fi museaum. I will start with 10 books from culture series and use open source AI model to create that sci-fi museam 


1. Define Core Entities:

    Books: This entity represents the science fiction books. Attributes include title, author, publication year, genre, summary, and digital copy (if available).
    AI Models: These are the artificial intelligence models available in the market. Attributes include model name, provider, capabilities, and integration API details.
    Exhibits: Represents virtual museum exhibits. Each exhibit can be a combination of a book and an AI model, showing how AI concepts are reflected in the book, or vice versa.

2. Top 3 Features:

    Interactive Exhibits: Virtual rooms where users can explore the content of a book and interact with AI models that are relevant to the book's themes.
    AI-Driven Recommendations: Using AI to recommend books and exhibits based on user preferences and browsing history.
    Community Engagement: Features like discussion forums, live chat with experts, and user-generated content submission.

3. API Endpoints:
Books API:

    GET /books: Retrieve a list of books.
    GET /books/{id}: Get details of a specific book.
    POST /books: Add a new book (admin only).

AI Models API:

    GET /models: Retrieve a list of AI models.
    GET /models/{id}: Get details of a specific model.

Exhibits API:

    GET /exhibits: List all exhibits.
    GET /exhibits/{id}: Details of a specific exhibit.
    POST /exhibits: Create a new exhibit (combining book and AI model).

User Interaction API:

    POST /exhibits/{id}/feedback: Submit feedback for an exhibit.
    GET /recommendations: Get book and exhibit recommendations.

4. Design Evolution:
Phase 1: Basic Structure

    Develop the backend to manage books and AI models.
    Create basic front-end for listing books and models.

Phase 2: Exhibit Integration

    Develop the exhibits feature, linking books and AI models.
    Introduce interactive elements in the exhibits.

Phase 3: User Engagement and AI Integration

    Implement AI-driven recommendations.
    Add community engagement features like forums and live chats.

Phase 4: Refinement and Scaling

    Refine user experience based on feedback.
    Scale the infrastructure to handle increased traffic.

5. Additional Considerations:

    Security: Implement robust authentication and authorization, especially for admin endpoints.
    Performance: Use caching and efficient database queries to ensure smooth user experience.
    Scalability: Design the backend to be scalable, possibly using cloud services.
    User Interface: Develop an engaging and intuitive UI, possibly using frameworks like JavaFX for the frontend.

# Data Acquition
1. Obtain ligth curve data from TESS archives
2. LightCurve has functions that allow search for and download this data directly within the package

# Preprocessing Data
1. clean the light curva data using lightKurve's tools
2. remove noise,outliers, normalize the data, correct systematic trends

# Transit Search
1. algo to search for periodic dips in brightness

# Transit modeling
1. once transits are found,  model them to estimate the planet's properties like size, orbital period

# Valildation
1. confirm that signals are from planets and not false positvies
2. check consistent transit depth, duration and shape 

####### Automation ######## 
1. Data retrivel ---> use MAST API to retrieve light curve data
2. Automate ---> the download and storage of light currve files using a scheduled job and a trigger based on data availability
3. Preprocessing ---> write scripts using LightKurve or similar library to clean the data ---. flatten the curve,remove outliers, noramlize the flux --> Automate all this
4. Transit signal detection --> Apply algorithms like BLS to search for periodic dips in brightness. ---> implement additional filtters to exclude false positives
5. candidate validation ---> use machine learning models trained on confirmed exoplanets to predict the likliehood of each candidate ---> features could include transit parameters, stellar characteristics and derived statistical measures --> implement feedback loo where candidates marked as false positives help retrain the model 
6. Catalogue and review ---> store detected candidates in db with all parameters ---> provide web interface for astronomers to review candidates
7. Notification system ---> create alerts for high probability candidates 
8. Integration with Observatories ---> for high probability candidates, automate the process of requesting follow up observations from ground based observatories.

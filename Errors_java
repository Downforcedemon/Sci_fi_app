# InvalidDefinitionException --> No serializer found for class scifimuseum.com.BookDTO and no properties discovered to create BeanSerializer (to avoid exception, disable SerializationFeature.FAIL_ON_EMPTY_BEANS)
SOLUTION: jackson was unable to covert java objects of backend to json format for web browser.
jackson couldn't serialize the BookDTO because it needs getter methods to serialize object properties. 
jackson also needs fields in BookDTO to serialize so class needs non-static, non-transparent fields

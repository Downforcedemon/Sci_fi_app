# ## unfolded light curve ---> 
# raw light curve displays the flux of the star over time.

# # # Normalized light curve --->
# The normalized light curve displays the flux of the star over time, but the flux has been normalized to a value of 1.0.
# compare the normalized light curve to the raw light curve 

### folded light curve --->
# fold at best period and epoch
# the biggest dip in the light curve is the transit event
# tall spike is strongest signal corresponsts to orbital period of the planet

### BLS Periodogram --->    
# tall spike is strongest signal corresponsts to orbital period of the planet

### phase folded light curve --->
# light data is folded at the period of the strongest period found by BLS method.
# x-axis is the phase of the orbit and y-axis is the flux of the star
# phase 0 is the transit event
# transit is deep drop in flux at the same phase each time 


## Flow of the diagram show in React app
# 1. User triggers an event in React app that checks diagrams of stars for one day
# 2. React app makes a request to the backend server which is java/flask app
# 3. server calls the python service which processes the data and generate diagrams ---> Search_new.py 
# 4. python services saves the diagrams and returns the file paths to the server ---> diagram_generator.py 
# 4. server responds to the frontend with image URLs or encoded images
# 5. React app displays the images to the user
